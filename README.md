Why?

### Initial Setup

-   Fork the [original repo](https://github.com/yearn/yearn.fi) into your GitHub account
-   Clone the forked repo from your GitHub account to your local machine

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your-gh>/yearn.fi.git
    ```

-   Set origin to your fork. This is where you push your changes to. This is done automatically by the step above.

    ```
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-gh>/yearn.fi
    ```

-   Set upstream to original repo.

    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/yearn/yearn.fi.git
    ```

-   Optional: Create `.env` file in root directory of repo then copy contents of `.env.example` to `.env` and replace values with your own keys. If you do not do this the default values from `next.config.js` will be used.

    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
